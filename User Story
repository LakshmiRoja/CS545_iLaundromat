Art Vandelay was a hedge fund manager based in New York City. He commuted everyday from his apartment at Upper West Side to his 
office on Wall St. Mr Vandelay was a single guy with no family. He lived. Being in hedge funds meant long hours at work, sometimes
even 60 hours at a stretch. This typically meant, he did not have enough time to do laundry at home as he was barely there. But as 
he needed fresh clothes, he had to wash them somewhere. But this gave birth to another problem namely having to spend two hours 
every week of his precious time at a Laundromat. Then he came across a web service called iLaundromat which eased his dilemma. 
With iLaundromat, Mr Vandelay only has to now deposit his unwashed clothes at a laundry, he then gets the status and control of 
his laundry in his palm. He can see when the laundry manager washes the clothes, when they are put for drying and when they are 
ready to be collected. Additionally he can control whether the wash has to be a hot wash or a cold wash, whether bleach needs to 
be added and for how much time the clothes need to be dried. iLaundromat has saved Art Vandelay’s valuable time.
