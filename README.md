# CS545_iLaundromat

In city like Hoboken, there are several laundromats where the system is traditional, i.e. we are expected to go to the laundromat personally i.e. the customer is expected to put the clothes in the washer then wait till they are done, after that, user again puts them in dryer and wait until the process gets completed and ultimately pays and leave. We came up with an idea to make this system online where the user would have to come once and handover his clothes which are to be washed to the laundromat manager. Then the manager would assign the customer a unique id which include weight of the cloths. User/customer has to sign up with unique id given by manager, name, email-id, contact number, bleaching white cloths, water temperature (hot, warm and cold water) for washing clothes, ironing clothes etc.Based on selected option price will be calculated automatically which will be shown on the same page. He has to pay the bill at a same time. Manager will wash/dry/iron the clothes and when cloths will be ready, administrator of the system would notify the user for final completion. The customer would then check the notification and ultimately come to pickup the clothes, thereby saving his time as he won’t have to wait in laundromat premises when washing and drying is being done.We chose to design this system because we wanted to save customer time by giving him an option to come for pick-up of clothes when they are done.
